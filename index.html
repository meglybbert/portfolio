      <h2 class="about">ABOUT</h2>
      <p>I am a Visual Communication Design senior at Eastern Washington University with a desire to improve the world through design. I have experience with user interaction design, interior design, web and print design, and research. I enjoy seeking out and solving the seemingly small problems that have a large impact on life - getting the pebble out of the shoe, if you will. Such problems can include a logo that just isn't quite right, a confusing website, or a poster that isn't garnering enough attention. In my spare time, I love to read, crochet, play piano, and spend time outside exploring the world. I hope to be able to use the skills I gain both in and out of the academic environment to help people like you fulfill your design needs. To learn more about me and my work, follow me on social media or contact me via email.</p>
